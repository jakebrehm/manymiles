## Main features

- Create secure user accounts, with the ability to delete them as well
- Track their driving habits using a sleek, minimal interface
- Download their records to a csv file for storage and analysis
- Learn about their driving habits via metrics and visualizations
- Interact with their data from anywhere using an API

## Getting set up

The source code can be viewed on Github [here](https://github.com/jakebrehm/manymiles).

## API documentation

**ManyMiles** features an API that allows users to perform operations such as add a new record or delete their most recent record. The main documentation lives [here](https://docs.manymiles.app), but you can also view the [Swagger UI](https://manymiles.app/api/docs) version as well.

### Siri shortcuts

A few Siri Shortcuts are available for iOS and MacOS devices to make recording your mileage and interacting with your data as painless as possible. Once you've set up the shortcuts in your Shortcuts app, you should be able to use the following voice commands with Siri:
- ["Let's record my mileage"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b931a703983349c18b90ab9bf52cd695)
- ["What was my last record?"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d59656250b4847b9af0cb4dd9de11858)
- ["Delete my last record"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c3129bd6cad64d8780a7cca88606a7a4)

## Future improvements

- Create a demo for prospective users
- Allow users to reset their password via email
- Provide more metrics and visualizations
- Set up an admin dashboard
- Incorporate extensive unit testing
